# Overview

This project explores the changing landscape of movie durations on Netflix. Leveraging Python, pandas, and matplotlib, I delve into the provided 'netflix_data.csv' dataset to validate a claim that the average length of movies on Netflix is declining. The analysis involves filtering movies, categorizing genres, and visualizing movie duration trends over release years.

# The Approach

Initially, the 'netflix_data.csv' dataset is prepared, focusing on movies and selecting key columns. The analysis involves filtering movies with durations under 60 minutes and categorizing genres with color coding for visual clarity. A scatter plot, generated using matplotlib, illustrates trends in movie durations over release years. The visualization aims to validate the claim and identify potential contributing factors, offering a concise yet insightful perspective on the evolving landscape of Netflix movie lengths.

# Results and Insights

The analysis showcases a visual representation of movie duration trends on Netflix, offering insights into potential changes over the years. The scatter plot provides a nuanced understanding of the claim, allowing for further exploration into contributing factors affecting movie lengths on the platform.
# Skills Demonstrated
