# Overview

This project employs a data-driven approach to guide a Singapore-based fitness studio in understanding the digital fitness product landscape in the regional market. The analysis, conducted in Python, focuses on Google Trends and YouTube keyword searches to assess global demand, identify influential keywords, analyze regional interests, and derive insights for strategic product management decisions.
# Approach

My approach begins by evaluating the seasonality and patterns of global interest in workouts, utilizing 'workout.csv' and employing pandas for comprehensive analysis. I then delve into 'three_keywords.csv' to identify current and trending keywords. Geographic data in 'workout_global.csv' guides the identification of top countries with the highest interest in workouts. Focusing on the Middle East and South Asia (MESA) region, I filter relevant countries using 'geo_three_keywords.csv.' A detailed analysis of interest splits within MESA countries is conducted using pandas. Lastly, I explore YouTube keyword searches for Singapore and the Philippines, identifying potential digital content types for effective market positioning.
# Results and Insights

The analysis provides valuable insights into global and regional fitness trends, aiding strategic decision-making for digital product offerings. Identified peak demand periods, influential keywords, and regional preferences contribute to a targeted and informed approach to product management.
# Skills Demonstrated

Proficiency is demonstrated in data loading, visualization, geographic analysis, and strategic decision-making, showcasing a robust skill set in business analytics.
